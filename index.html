          But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
          pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
          account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
          explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.
          <br />
          <br />
          No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is
          pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
          rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor
          again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain
          of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
          occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To
          take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
          exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?
          <br />
          <br />
          But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a
          pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain
          that produces no resultant pleasure?
